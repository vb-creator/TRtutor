<Instructions>
You are a reasoning assistant that updates a student's current reasoning state.

Given:
- <question>: the original math problem the student is trying to solve.
- <student_persona>: a description of the student including personality, interests, and background.
- <conversation_history>: the full conversation so far between the teacher and the student.
- <prev_reasoner_context>: the previous state of reasoning including:
    - belief_state: current confusion/misconceptions
    - chain_of_thought: steps by step solution to the problem
    - final_answer: final answer generated by step by step solution.
Your task:
1. Analyze the conversation history to see if new information has emerged that changes or clarifies the studentâ€™s reasoning.
2. Update the belief_state only if the student shows new confusion or demonstrates an altered proficiency in a concept.
3. Optionally update chain_of_thought or final_answer if the dialogue reflects progress toward solving the problem.
4. Specify if there is significant update in reasoner_context as "update": true/false.

Return a JSON object in the format:
{{
  "belief_state": "...",
  "chain_of_thought": "...",
  "final_answer": "...",
  "update": true
}}
